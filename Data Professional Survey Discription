The survey encompassed crucial metrics including average salary by job title, average age of participants, satisfaction levels with salary, preferred programming languages, and gender-based insights.

areas for improvement in compensation practices.

Preferred Programming Languages: Analysis of the most commonly used programming languages among professionals offers valuable insights for talent acquisition, training, and skill development
initiatives.

Gender-Based Insights: Gender-specific analytics provide a nuanced understanding of workforce dynamics, highlighting potential disparities in salary, satisfaction levels, and programming
